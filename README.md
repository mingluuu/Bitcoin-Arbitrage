# FinTech_Challenge_3
**Overview**
----
Looking over historical data value of Bitcoin during the first three months of 2018 (January, February and March) on two different exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase.

The goal is to Collect CSV data in a Jupyter notebook file. Prepare the datasets for analysis by cleaning missing and erroneous data. Analyze the data at a high level through summary statistics and visualizations. Use this information to select areas for deeper analysis. Differentiate between early in the timeframe and later in the timeframe. Specifically, selecting time periods in which to identify arbitrage opportunities.

Analyzing data over 2 different monthy period in 2018: from January 01 to January 31 and from March 01 to March 31. Analyzing data over 3 specific days: January 16, February 24 and March 26.

After analyzing the data, we can see the arbitrage between Coinbase and Bitstamp was possible to be realized with a profit early on but disapeared with time.
